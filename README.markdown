Tutorial
===========

To get started:

Fork

If you’d like to add features (or bug fixes) to improve the application, you can fork the GitHub repo and make pull requests. Your code contributions are more than welcome!

Clone

If you want to copy and customize the app with changes that are only useful for your own project, you can clone the GitHub repo. Tutorli is only mentioned in the brand class. You'll need to search-and-replace the project name throughout the application. Search for Your Site and replace if with your project name. Also, there are mailers that you'll need to set up. Just search for yourdomain.com and replace it with your own. To clone:
```
$ git clone git://github.com/palderson/tutorli.git
```
You’ll need git on your machine.

Set Up
===========

A couple of obvious steps:
```
$ bundle
$ rake db:migrate
```
Next, creating an Admin user is achieved through a rake tast. Open the file admin.rake and add your credentials. Then run:
```
$ rake admin:create
```
There's also a rake task to create a set of sample data, which includes users, courses, lessons, publishing courses and enrolemnts. Run:
```
$ rake sample:create
```
Dependancies
===========

The application relies on a number of thirdparty services. You'll need to register for these services to generat an API_Key. The services are:

Stripe: 
Update the stripe.rb file with your information. Provisions have been made for both the test and production environments:
```
if Rails.env == 'production'
  Stripe.api_key = "PRODUCTION_KEY"
  STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY = "PRODUCTION_PUBLIC_KEY"
else
  Stripe.api_key = "TEST_PRODUCTION_KEY"
  STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY = "TEST_PRODUCTION_PUBLIC_KEY"
end
```
Filepicker.io
Course supporting file uploads are handled by Filepicker.io. Bio images are handled by Paperclip (pull requests to unify this are welcome). Nevertheless, you'll need to input your own Filepicker information, and provide your Amazon credentials to Filepicker.io. Add your API key to the application.rb file:
```
config.filepicker_rails.api_key = 'API_KEY'
```
Amazon S3:
S3 information is contained in the file amazon_s3.yml. Input your information. You may also specify in Filepicker or the application itself a specific folder for each upload path.
```
development:
  access_key_id: TEST_KEY
  secret_access_key: TEST_SECRET

test:
  access_key_id: TEST_KEY
  secret_access_key: TEST_KEY

production:
  access_key_id: PRODUCTION_KEY
  secret_access_key: PRODUCTION_KEY
```
Pandastream:
The application was previously hosted on Heroku, which employs 2 second timeouts. This caused a lot of issues when uploading video. The eventual solution was to use the Pandastream Heroku app. To set this up, you'll need to add the app to your application on Heroku with the following command:
```
$ heroku addons:add pandastream 
```
Also, Pandastream caps the file size of the upload as part of the free account. To support video uploads of any decent size, you'll need to the Solo offering.

Sendgrid:
Mailers are hendled by Sendgrid. This again is an Heroku app. Just run the below and set up an account on Sendgrid.
```
$ heroku addons:add sendgrid 
```

Summary
===========

The above should provide you much or what you need to get started. There are a few issues with the code, although nothing that can't be overcome.

Also, I should say that for any newbies, the code certainly does not represent best practices. There's a lot that could be improved as to how it's been built. With that said, it works!

Lastly, if encountering this bug:
```
Fix for Nokogiri w. libxml2 2.7.8 loading libxml2 2.7.3
```
